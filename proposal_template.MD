**ML Use Case**: 

House Price Prediction
- Predicting a sale price for a house based on the geographical variables (region location and distance from CBD).
- Predicting a sale price for a house based on the size of house (ex: number of bedrooms).

**ML model selected**: 

Random forest regressor.

**Reason**: 

Given that the objective of this project is to predict the price of a house, which is a numerical and continuous output, this is a regression task. Therefore, the random forest regression machine learning model is used. While the random forest requires a significant amount of time to train, it provides the best accuracy and ideal prediction. In addition, the data set we chose is large and contains a variety of variables, and the random forest algorithm is well-suited for processing large amounts of data and executing complex tasks.
